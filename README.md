# Earthquake Azure Data Engineering Pipeline

## Overview and Architecture

### Business Case

Earthquake data is incredibly valuable for understanding seismic events and mitigating risks. Government agencies, research institutions, and insurance companies rely on up-to-date information to plan emergency responses and assess risks. With this automated pipeline, we ensure these stakeholders get the latest data in a way that’s easy to understand and ready to use, saving time and improving decision-making.

### Architecture Overview

This pipeline follows a modular architecture, integrating Azure’s powerful data engineering tools to ensure scalability, reliability, and efficiency. The architecture includes:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Azure Data Factory orchestrates the daily ingestion of earthquake data from the USGS Earthquake API.
2. **Data Processing**: Databricks processes raw data into structured formats (bronze, silver, gold tiers).
3. **Data Storage**: Azure Data Lake Storage serves as the backbone for storing and managing data at different stages.
4. **Data Analysis**: Synapse Analytics enables querying and aggregating data for reporting.
5. **Optional Visualization**: Power BI can be used to create interactive dashboards for stakeholders.

### Data Modeling

We implement a **medallion architecture** to structure and organize data effectively:

1. **Bronze Layer**: Raw data ingested directly from the API, stored in Parquet format for future reprocessing if needed.
2. **Silver Layer**: Cleaned and normalized data, removing duplicates and handling missing values, ensuring it’s ready for analytics.
3. **Gold Layer**: Aggregated and enriched data tailored to specific business needs, such as adding in country codes.

### Understanding the API

- The earthquake API provides detailed seismic event data for a specified start and end date.
- **Start Date**: Defines the range of data. This is dynamically set via Azure Data Factory for daily ingestion.
- **API URL**: `https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/`

## **Technologies Used**
